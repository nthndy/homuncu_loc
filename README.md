Welcome to the _*homunculoc*_ project repository! This project aims to study host-pathogen interactions using a Lung-on-a-Chip platform at the Francis Crick Institute in collaboration with Alveolix. The repository provides tools for single-cell segmentation and tracking of lung-on-a-chip samples, enabling quantification of cell type and behavior. This README will guide you through the project and its components.

## Introduction

The Lung-on-a-Chip project aims to replicate and study the complex interactions between host cells and pathogens in a controlled microfluidic environment. This repository contains code and resources to perform single-cell segmentation and tracking, facilitating the analysis and quantification of cellular behavior within the lung-on-a-chip system.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/homunculoc.git`

2. Install the required dependencies listed in the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section.
3. Set up the Python environment by creating a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and installing the necessary packages. Example using `venv`:

``python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt``

4. Install the Python package `btrack` by following the instructions provided in its documentation.
