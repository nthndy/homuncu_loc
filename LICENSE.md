# Licensing Information

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for the Lung-on-a-Chip project, a collaborative effort between  Host-Pathogen Interactions in Tuberculosis Laboratory and Alveolix. The project aims to study host-pathogen interactions using a Lung-on-a-Chip platform at the Francis Crick Institute. As the project involves intellectual property belonging to Alveolix, it is necessary to adopt a dual licensing approach to address the proprietary nature of certain components while making the codebase accessible to the wider community.

## Licensing Approach

To accommodate the different aspects of the project, the following licensing approach has been implemented:

1. **Proprietary License for Collaborator**: The parts of the project that involve the practical implementation of experiments and contain proprietary or intellectual property belonging to Alveolix are licensed under a private or proprietary license. This license restricts access, usage, and distribution only to Host-Pathogen Interactions in Tuberculosis Laboratory and Alveolix. The licensing terms and restrictions are governed by the agreements between the parties involved.

2. **Open-Source License for Codebase**: The code and image analysis components of the Lung-on-a-Chip project are made available under the MIT License. This open-source license allows users to view, use, modify, and distribute the code, subject to the following conditions:
